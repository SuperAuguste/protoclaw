## Usage

### CLI

### `build.zig` Integration

You can use `protoclaw.GenerateStep` to generate Zig sources from Protobuf schemas in your `build.zig`. 
See [our `build.zig`](TODO) for an example. 

### Source File vs Include

In protoclaw, these are no different except that declarations from source files are public and declarations from included sources are private. You can override this behavior:

| Where | How |
| ----- | ---- |
| CLI | `protoclaw ... --visibility=all-public` |
| `build.zig` | `generate_step.visibility = .all_public;` |
